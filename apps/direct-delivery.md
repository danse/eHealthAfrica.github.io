**Immunization information management in Nigeria\'s last-mile**

Based on a request from the Kano State Government for support in RI supply chain management, eHealth Africa in 2014 began the Move project. Executed entirely in Kano, it produced a design process and a technical stack which addresses many of the key challenges in digital data collection in the last mile. It also produced a mobile application for last mile supply chain management, Move.
