# Sense Followup

Sense Followup is eHealth Africaâ€™s mobile, offline-first application for contact tracing, first developed during the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria. It is optimised for use with cheap Android smartphones or tablets and allows contact tracers to quickly follow up on contacts by adding temperature reading and symptoms observed, together with optional observations and the GPS coordinates of the followup.
