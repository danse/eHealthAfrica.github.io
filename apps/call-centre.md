eHealth Africaâ€™s Call Centre software suite is optimised for quick setup of call centres during disease outbreaks. The software is usable both for supporting operators in providing health information to callers, as well as starting actions for people with disease symptoms and their relatives calling in, people calling about dead bodies or ambulances calling.

It allows call centre operators to record all information needed about callers, patients, and more details, and forward the call information to a dispatcher immediately, so that appropriate actions can be taken.

Additionally, the software enables monitors and supervisors to generate reports about activities, implement control mechanisms for quality assessments and improve their staff planning. It also enables data analysts to gather information about areas most affected by disease outbreaks and start appropriate measurements together with government officials.

The call centre software was used in Nigeria first, and is still being used in Guinea and Sierra Leone, with our most recent deployment being Liberia. In total for all sites, operators handle and track more than 15,000 calls per day.
