Our mobile applications are developed mostly for Android and thus follow the [Android UI guidelines for writing style](http://developer.android.com/design/style/writing.html). It’s a good idea to read them for yourself in their entirety (they are short), but here is a summary.

- Concise: Omit needless words.
- Simple: Short words, active verbs, and common nouns; front-load most important information in first 11 characters.
- Friendly: Use contractions, talk directly to the reader, put user goal first. Be casual in tone but avoid slang.
- Use “Your” and “You” instead of “My” and “Me”, e.g. “Your profile”, not “My profile”. Avoid possessives where possible, e.g “Recent visits” vs. “Your visits”.
- Use nouns as subjects, avoid “There is” and similar constructions with “disappeared” subjects.
- Prefer positive to negative language, e.g. stop, cancel, end vs. exit to abort, kill, terminate. In general, use positive phrasing (“Do…” instead of “Don’t…”)
- Tell readers consequences of actions when asking for confirmation instead of whether they are sure.

## Formatting
- Use sentence-style capitalization for all UI strings, including labels.
- Capitalize app names, named features and proper nouns, but be conservative in deciding whether something is a named feature (e.g. “Home screen” instead of “Home Screen”).
- Don’t use periods after single sentences.

## Typography
See the [Typography](/designers/typography/) section of the documentation.

## Preferred usage
- We use British English, Oxford spelling.
- It’s a _followup_ (noun) and _follow up_ (verb). Not follow-up for either. Similar to:
- It’s _login_ (noun) and _log in_ (verb)
- “Log in” over “Sign in”
- “Register” over “Sign up”

## Examples

### Simplicity:

Bad: _“Please specify what other symptoms you have observed”_

Better: _“What other symptoms have you seen?”_

Avoid needlessly complex words (i.e. “specify”, “observed”), front-load most important info (“What other symptoms” vs. “Please specify what other symptoms”).
